      <td>Formerly known as <em>WWE</em>, Inertia is a very strong contender for new player use, with a simple and clean GUI. A very strong contender, and can for sure be used standalone.</td>

      <td><a href="https://meteorclient.com/">Meteor</a></td>
      <td>Meteor is a long-developed latest version client, boasting strong PVP and some Anarchy bypasses. The GUI is clean, and the client is more than functional. This will most likely be one of the most used clients aside KAMI later down the line.</td>
      <td>Fabric only</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://www.wurstclient.net/">Wurst</a></td>
      <td>The name fits the bill. This client is nearly unusable, with no bypasses and no customizabilty. Mostly will not be used, or used by new players for Xray alone. Offers no PVP options. Only pros are fast at updating to the latest version and good for singleplayer. Avoid if possible.</td>
      <td>Fabric only</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://impactclient.net/">Impact</a></td>
      <td>The legendary client, Impact is a very beginner freindly free client, featuring large amounts of customizabilty, and a slick GUI. Currently Impact for 1.16.5 is in a Donator-only beta ($5). A Highly useful client, best paired with another (not possible on 1.16).</td>

      <td><a href="https://aresclient.org/">Ares</a></td>

      <td>Fabric only</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://sigmaclient.info/">Sigma</a></td>
      <td>Sigma is a standalone client (No other mods can be combined) specifically for Minigame bypasses. While it is an aesthetically pleasing client, A lack of Anarchy modules and many useful features behind a $20 paywall, Sigma is not a good option.</td>
      <td>Version files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/BleachDrinker420/bleachhack-1.14/releases">BleachHack</a></td>
      <td>A rather odd addition, BleachHack is a surprisingly useful client, with full-use mods and active development. the only gripe that makes me say this is best paired with another client is the Render modules.</td>
      <td>Fabric only</td>
